# PRD: AI-Powered Travel Assistant

## 1. Introduction/Overview

This document outlines the requirements for a new AI-powered travel assistant feature. The goal is to create a seamless and intelligent experience for users to search for and book flights and hotels in one place. Currently, users often have to visit multiple websites to plan and book their travel. This feature aims to solve that problem by providing a centralized, AI-driven platform, starting with flights and hotels. The primary user for this feature is the leisure traveler, who values convenience and good deals.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide a personalized and intelligent travel planning assistant.
*   To simplify the travel booking process by integrating flight and hotel search.
*   To allow users to book both their flight and hotel in a single transaction.
*   To increase user engagement and make our platform the go-to place for travel planning.

## 3. User Stories

*   As a leisure traveler, I want to search for flights and hotels using natural language so that I can easily express my travel needs.
*   As a user planning a vacation, I want to see flight and hotel options on a flexible interface so that I can mix and match to create my ideal trip.
*   As a traveler looking for convenience, I want to book my flight and hotel in a single checkout process so that I can save time and effort.
*   As a family planning a trip, I want to find good deals on flight and hotel packages so that I can stay within my budget.

## 4. Functional Requirements

1.  The system must provide a search interface that accepts natural language queries for flights (e.g., "flights to Paris for 2 people next month").
2.  The system must be able to parse natural language queries to extract travel parameters (destination, dates, number of travelers, etc.).
3.  The system must display flight search results based on the user's query.
4.  The system must display hotel search results relevant to the flight destination and dates.
5.  The user interface must be flexible, allowing users to view and select flights and hotels independently before combining them.
6.  Users must be able to add a selected flight and a selected hotel to a cart or a combined itinerary.
7.  The system must support a single checkout process for booking both the flight and the hotel.
8.  The system must process the payment for the combined booking in a single transaction.
9.  The system must send a confirmation to the user with details for both the flight and hotel booking.
10. The system must be built to enable modular “agent” components, so new service integration (e.g., activities, customer support) can be added without major re-engineering.

## 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

*   The initial version will not include rental cars, activities, or other travel-related items.
*   The AI will not support complex, multi-city travel planning in the first release.
*   Personalized recommendations based on past user behavior will be a future enhancement, not part of the initial scope.
*   Predictive features (e.g., price prediction) are not in scope for the initial release.

## 6. Design Considerations

*   The user interface should be clean, intuitive, and flexible, allowing users to easily switch between flight and hotel views and see their combined itinerary.
*   The design should be responsive and work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   A visual "cart" or "trip" summary should be present to show the selected flight and hotel before booking.

## 7. Technical Considerations

*   The system will need to integrate with one or more Flight Search APIs (e.g., Amadeus, Skyscanner).
*   The system will need to integrate with one or more Hotel Search APIs (e.g., Expedia, Booking.com).
*   A robust payment gateway is required to handle combined payments.
*   The natural language processing (NLP) component will need to be developed or integrated to handle search queries.
*   The backend architecture will leverage a modular agent-based framework (e.g., CrewAI) to orchestrate core functions—NLP parsing, API calls for flights/hotels, payment processing, and booking persistence. 
*   Agent orchestration will enable chaining and parallel execution of tasks (e.g., parsing user intent, querying APIs, assembling results), which increases scalability and makes it easier to add new workflows (like activities, customer support escalation, etc.) in the future.
*   Integration via an agent automation layer will also allow experimentation with multiple travel APIs, dynamic switching, and smart fallback strategies.

## 8. Success Metrics

*   Increase in the number of users booking both a flight and a hotel through the platform.
*   High user satisfaction scores (measured via surveys) for the new feature.
*   Reduction in the time it takes for a user to book a flight and hotel.
*   Increase in conversion rate for travel bookings.

## 9. Open Questions

*   Which specific flight and hotel APIs will we use for the initial launch?
*   What are the technical requirements and limitations of the chosen APIs for combined booking?
*   What is the plan for handling customer support for these bundled bookings (e.g., cancellations, changes)?
